Currently there are six files necessary for the running of the whole model:

1. main.py: Controlling the whole process by defining data loading method, model size and training hyper-parameters. Please refer to the related python script for further details.
2. model.py: Our VAE Model. Please refer to the related paper for the detailed discussion of the structure, training and inferencing of the model.
3. data_prepare.py: As discussed in our article, we currently use 3 datasets, which are ISP, GeoLife, and FourSquare (NYC & TKY), for our experiments. Classes implemented in this python script allow users to load the data with the exact location dividing mode he/she may fancy with a simple call. Viewers may look at the implementation of the data pre-process method if you are interested in the reliability of the data and the results of our model.
4. result_evaluation.py: Implementations for the evaluation of the synthetized trajactories generated by our model and the corresponding baselines. Please refer to the related paper for the detailed discussion of the meaning of each evaluation criteria.
5. semi_markov.py: Implementation of the simplest baseline we use in our experiments.
5. lstm.py: Implementation of the baseline of LSTM we use in our experiments.
