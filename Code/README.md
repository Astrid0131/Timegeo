1. main.py: Controlling the whole experiment by defining a series of hyperparameters related to the structure of the loaded dataset, the structure of the model, the training and generating procedure, and the modes of the experiments. Please refer to the related python script for further details.
2. model.py: Our VAE Model implemented in a hierarchical way. Please refer to the related paper for the detailed discussion of the structure of the model and the inference and generation procedure. 
3. data_prepare.py: As discussed in our article, we currently use 3 datasets, which are ISP, GeoLife, and FourSquare (both NYC and TKY), in our experiments. Viewers are welcomed to look at the implementation of the data pre-processing if you are interested in the reliability of the data and the results of our model.
4. result_evaluation.py: Functions implemented for the evaluation of the synthetized trajactories generated by our model and the corresponding baselines. The functions are divided into 3 different groups by their objects, including usability evaluation, uniqueness evaluation, and case study. Please refer to the related paper for the detailed discussion of each evaluation criterium and case study method.
5. baselines.py: Implementation of the model-based baselines, i.e. Semi-Markov Model, Hawkes Process Model, and TimeGeo Model. 
6. lstm.py: Implementation of the data-based baseline: LSTM model.
