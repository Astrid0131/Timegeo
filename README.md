# TrajSynVAE


## Baselines

* **TimeGeo**: The method built based on the explore and preferential return (EPR) model [PNAS 2016].
* **Semi-Markov**: In this model, the waiting time is modeled by the exponential distribution. Dirichlet prior and gamma prior are used to model the transition matrix and the intensity of the waiting time to implement a Bayesian inference.
* **LSTM*: This model directly predicts the next locations and waiting time based on the LSTM network, and the prediction results are utilized as the synthesized trajectories.
* **MoveSim**: The model proposed to synthesize human trajectories based on GAN, which introduces prior knowledge and physical regularities to the SeqGAN model [KDD 2020]
